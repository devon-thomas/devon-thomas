- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @devon-thomas
- I'm currently an RF/Mixed Signal Designer with a personal interest in learning more coding techniques. 
- I'm working through leetcode problems and enjoying the new algorithms! 
- I've chosen to learn python, as that's all the rage for non-programmers although I am fluent in Matlab.
